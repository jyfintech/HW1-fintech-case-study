# Wealthfront Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

Wealthfront

* When was the company incorporated?

Wealthfront was founded in 2008, in Palo Alto, CA.

* Who are the founders of the company?

Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Before Wealthfront, Andy Rachless co-founded Benchmark, a venture capital firm that provides seed funding to startups. At the same time, he was also a lecturer at Standford, teaching courses on entrepreneurships. Students often seek investment advices from him as he had a very successful career in the industry; he was often unable to provide a recommendation because the services he used had a high minimum requirement - something that's clearly not affordable for students and new graduates.

Dan Caroll was a former trader and his parents had been hit by the financial crisis in 2008. Even though they had a financial advisor but they didn't get the attention that they paid for. He decided to change this situation and started to build prototypes that eventually caught the eye of Andy.

They both realized that not everyone has access to finance advices that they deserve and many of the tools that are used for financial analysis are outdated. They believed that software can make investing easier and available for more people.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Wealthfront received funding from a number of venture capital firms, including Benchmark Capital, DAG Ventures, Index Ventures, The Social+Capital Partnership, as well as fundings from individuals. By 2014, they received a total funding of $65.5 million.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Wealthfront falls under the category of wealth management and is one of the most well-recognized robo-advisors in the US. Previously, people with a limited amount of money to invested do not have a good way to get financial advices. This is because many of the services were not automated by softwares and thus have a high bar for selecting their clients.

By using software, financial services become more scalable and the cost is greatly reduced. Therefore, their services can be made available to a wide range of audience and people can create an account with $500 to invest.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Intended customers are those people with limited capital to invest. These include the majority of individuals and families in the country as the median household income for US is around $50,000 to $55,000.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Wealthfront is using React and JavaScript for their webapp apps; Objective-C/Swift for iOS apps and Java/Kotlin for their Android apps. Their services are written in C++ and are hosted using Google Cloud Platform, with Amazon Cloudfront as their content delivery network. They also use D3.js for visualization.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Expand the asset classes and offer services for cryptocurrencies and NFT. These assets are getting more and more attention from investors and even though they have higher risks than traditional securities, they can potentially deliver higher returns.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Blockchain is relatively new compared to other traditional securities and has a big upside that can potentially make Wealthfront deliver a higher annualized return, which will attract more individuals and household families and lead to wider adoption of its services. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Expanding the asset classes to the field of cryptocurrencies and NFT would utilize many of the features of blockchain technology. Wallets for deposit and withdrawl needs to be set up as part of the account creation process. And in case of NFT, surfaces that allow visualization of those digital creations also needs to be implemented. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

There are many cryptocurrencies that already have adequate liquitity for automated trading. In case of NFT and commodify digital arts, this is particular suitable for the retirement accounts that Wealthfront offers as these accounts are generally for very long term investments.
