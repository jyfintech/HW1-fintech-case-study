# Wealthfront Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

Wealthfront

* When was the company incorporated?

Wealthfront was founded in 2008, in Palo Alto, CA.

* Who are the founders of the company?

Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Before Wealthfront, Andy Rachless co-founded Benchmark, a venture capital firm that provides seed funding to startups. At the same time, he was also a lecturer at Standford, teaching courses on entrepreneurships. Students often seek investment advices from him as he had a very successful career in the industry; he was often unable to provide a recommendation because the services he used had a high minimum requirement - something that's clearly not affordable for students and new graduates.

Dan Caroll was a former trader and his parents had been hit by the financial crisis in 2008. Even though they had a financial advisor but they didn't get the attention that they paid for. He decided to change this situation and started to build prototypes that eventually caught the eye of Andy.

They both realized that not everyone has access to finance advices that they deserve and many of the tools that are used for financial analysis are outdated. They believed that software can make investing easier and available for more people.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Wealthfront received funding from a number of venture capital firms, including Benchmark Capital, DAG Ventures, Index Ventures, The Social+Capital Partnership, as well as fundings from individuals. By 2014, they received a total funding of $65.5 million.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Wealthfront falls under the category of wealth management and is one of the most well-recognized robo-advisors in the US. Previously, people with a limited amount of money to invested do not have a good way to get financial advices. This is because many of the services were not automated by softwares and thus have a high bar for selecting their clients.

By using software, financial services become more scalable and the cost is greatly reduced. Therefore, their services can be made available to a wide range of audience and people can create an account with $500 to invest.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Intended customers are those people with limited capital to invest. These include the majority of individuals and families in the country as the median household income for US is around $50,000 to $55,000.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)



## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

They are in the domain of wealth management and robo-advisors.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Major trends for the domain of wealth management are themed around automation. The costs of software and machines are generally lower than people and the speed of execution is faster.

This is something that will take a huge amount of effort for humans to do.
